## üöÄ Getting Started

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the `linux_console_manager` repository from GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/forsys02/linux_console_manager.git
   cd linux_console_manager
   chmod +x go.sh
   chmod 600 go.env
   ```

2. **Make it Executable from Anywhere (Optional):**
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/go.sh" /bin/go
   ```
   Now you can simply type `go` in your terminal to launch the menu.

3. **Run `go.sh`:**
   ```bash
   ./go.sh
   # or if you created the symlink:
   go
   ```

4. **Explore the Menu:** Use the number keys or shortcut letters (shown in `[]`) to navigate the menu.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`go.env`)

The power of `go.sh` lies in its customizable configuration file, `go.env`.  Here's how you can tailor it to your needs:

- **Menu Structure:**  Define your main menu and submenus using `%%%` to start a menu section and blank lines to separate menu items. Submenus are created by nesting menu sections.
- **Comments:** Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and are ignored by the script. Use these to add notes and explanations within your `go.env`.
- **Commands:**  Each menu item executes the commands listed below it (until the next `%%%` or blank line).  Use standard bash commands.
- **Variables:** Use `varVARIABLE_NAME__default_value` to define variables that users can input directly from the menu.  Default values are provided for convenience.
- **Submenus:** Create nested menus using `%%% {submenu_shortcut}Menu Title [shortcut]` and `%%%e {submenu_shortcut}English Menu Title [shortcut]` for multilingual support.
- **English Menu:**  Use `%%%e` for menu titles and commands that should be displayed when the system locale is not Korean.
- **Custom Functions:**  Extend `go.sh` by adding your own bash functions at the end of the `go.sh.txt` file and calling them from your menu items.
- **`conf` Command:**  From the main menu or any submenu, type `conf` and press Enter to directly edit the `go.env` file using `vi`.

**Example `go.env` Snippets:**

```txt
# System Information Menu
%%% ÏãúÏä§ÌÖú Ï†ïÎ≥¥ / ÌîÑÎ°úÏÑ∏Ïä§ Í¥ÄÎ¶¨ [s]
%%%e System Information / Process Management [s]
%% uname -a ;echo
%% echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
%% w
```

```txt
# Submenu Example
%%% ÏãúÏä§ÌÖú Í¥ÄÎ¶¨ [m]
%%%e System Management [m]
{submenu_sys}

%%% {submenu_sys}ÎÑ§Ìä∏ÏõåÌÅ¨ ÏÑ§Ï†ï [net]
%%%e {submenu_sys}Network Settings [net]
%% vi2 /etc/network/interfaces
%% systemctl restart networking
```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

- **Navigation:** Use number keys (1, 2, 3...) or shortcut letters (`[a]`, `[b]`, `[c]`, etc.) to select menu items.
- **Submenus:** Navigate deeper into submenus using their shortcut letters.
- **Command Execution:**  Selected menu items execute the commands defined in `go.env`.
- **Variable Input:** When a menu item with variables is selected, you'll be prompted to enter values for each variable.  Press Enter to use the default value.
- **Confirmation:** For "dangerous" commands (marked with `!!!`), you'll be asked for confirmation before execution.
- **Easter Egg:** Type `..` in the main menu to access a direct command-line interface with your `.bashrc` aliases loaded.
- **`conf` Command:** Type `conf` to edit `go.env` directly.
- **Exit:** Type `0` or `q` in the main menu to exit `go.sh`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Variables: Customize Your Commands

`go.sh` uses a simple variable system to make commands more dynamic and reusable.

- **Syntax:** `varVARIABLE_NAME__default_value`
    - `var`:  Indicates a variable.
    - `VARIABLE_NAME`:  The name of your variable (e.g., `PACKAGE`, `PORT`, `HOST`).
    - `__default_value`: (Optional) A default value that will be used if you don't provide input. Use `@@` for `/` in default paths.

- **Example:**
   ```txt
   %%% Ìå®ÌÇ§ÏßÄ ÏÑ§Ïπò [i]
   %%%e Install Package [i]
   yum install -y varPACKAGE__nginx
   ```
   When you select this menu item, you'll be prompted to enter a value for `PACKAGE`. If you just press Enter, it will default to `nginx`, and the command `yum install -y nginx` will be executed.

## üí° Tips and Tricks

- **Multilingual Support:** `go.sh` intelligently detects your locale and displays menus in Korean or English based on your system settings. You can force a language by setting the `envko` variable in `~/go.private.env` to `utf8` or `euckr`.
- **Hidden Menus:**  Create hidden submenus using `%%% {submenu_hidden}`. These menus won't be directly listed in the main menu but can be accessed via their shortcut keys or by calling them from other menu items.
- **Command History:**  `go.sh` keeps a history of your executed commands in `/tmp/go_history.txt`. Use the `h` shortcut in menus to view and re-execute recent commands.
- **Direct Command Input (Easter Egg):**  Type `..` in the main menu to enter a direct command-line mode where you can type any bash command and utilize your `.bashrc` aliases.
- **Custom Functions:**  Extend `go.sh` by adding your own bash functions to the `go.sh.txt` file. You can then call these functions directly from your menu items, creating powerful and specialized tools.
- **`conf` Command Workflow:** Use the `conf` command to quickly edit `go.env` directly from the menu. This is much faster than manually opening the file in `vi`.
